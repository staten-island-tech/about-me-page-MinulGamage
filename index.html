    <h2>A Day In Life of a Staten Island Tech Student</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Minul Gamage. I am a sophmore at Staten Island Tech. I am
      currently making this about me page in my AP computer science class. My
      average day at Tech starts at 6 a.m when I wake up. I eat breakfast and
      get to school at 7:50. I first go to English and after that I go to my
      Phys ed class. Then I go to AP computer science, physics, algebra, CAD,
      then finally lunch. After lunch I go to AP world history and lastly
      Russian. After school, I will sometimes hangout and play basketball with
      my friends. At about 5 I arrive home and study for about an hour. The
      activities I do after I study vary but I will usually play video games,
      draw, or read. Finally, I go to sleep at 10:30. That's about it.
